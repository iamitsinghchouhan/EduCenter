# EduCenter
Edu-centre (E-Learning Management System) is a project which aims in developing an online application to provide Online Education, maintain Study Materials, keep Student records and collect Payments. This project has login features, Educator as Admin and Student as an user can login into their own portal separately. The Admin can login, through which the admin can monitor the whole system. This System can be used to search for course, add new courses, edit course, check payment status etc. The Admin after logging into his account can generate reports such as sell Report. The User can login into his account to follow course he purchased and can share his/her feedback. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the Educator (Admin) as well as Students (User) to provide Teaching-Learning platform in the best way possible.
